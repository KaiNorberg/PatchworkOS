 *
 * The heap uses a "segregated free list" allocator with a set of bins where each bin stores free blocks of size `n *
 * 64` bytes up to a threshold, beyond which large allocations are mapped directly.
 *
 * We also keep track of a physical list of blocks which is be used to split and coalesce blocks when freeing memory.
 *
 * Below is the internal heap allocation, the functions that the kernel and user space should use are the expected
 * `malloc()`, `free()`, `realloc()`, etc functions.
 *
 * TODO: Implement a slab allocator.
