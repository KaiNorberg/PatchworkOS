 * This function always evaluates the \_SB._INI node if it exists, enumerates ACPI devices (found under \_SB), evaulates
 * their _STA object retrieving its present and functional status (if it exists) and then evaluates their _INI object
 * acording to these rules:
 * - If the _INI object does not exist it is ignored.
 * - If the _STA object does not exist the device is assumed to be present and functional
 * - If the _STA object does exist its status is read.
 * - Depending on the status returned by _STA or assumed, the device is treated in one of four ways:
 *  - If the device is not present and not functional, the device is ignored.
 *  - If the device is not present and functional, the device's _INI is ignored but its children are enumerated.
 *  - If the device is present and not functional, the device's _INI is evaluated and its children are enumerated.
 *  - If the device is present and functional, the device's _INI is evaluated and its children are enumerated.
 *
 * @see Section 6.5.1 of the ACPI specification for more details.

 * @return On success, 0. On failure, `ERR` and `errno` is set.
