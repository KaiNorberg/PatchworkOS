/**
 * @brief Processes.

 * @ingroup kernel
 *
 * Processes store the shared resources for threads of execution, for example the address space and open files.
 *
 * ## Process Filesystem
 *
 * Each process has a directory located at `/proc/[pid]`, which contains various files that can be used to interact with
 * the process. Additionally, there is a `/proc/self` bound mount point that points to the `/proc/[pid]` directory of
 * the current process. These files include:
 * - `prio`: A readable and writable file that contains the scheduling priority of the process.
 * - `cwd`: A readable file that contains the current working directory of the process.
 * - `cmdline`: A readable file that contains the command line arguments of the process (argv).
 * - `note`: A writable file that can be used to send notes (see `note_queue_t`) to the process.
 * - `wait`: A readable and pollable file that can be used to wait for the process to exit and retrieve its exit status.
