 *
 * The Physical Memory Manager (PMM) is responsible for managing physical memory pages. It uses a free stack for
 * allocating single pages in constant-time, and for more specialized allocations (requiring a specific address range
 * or alignment) a bitmap allocator is used. The bitmap allocator should only be used when no other option is available.
 *
 * All physical memory is identity mapped to the beginning of the higher half of the address space. This means that for
 * example `NULL` is always an invalid address and that the PMM returns addresses in the higher half.
 *
 * The free stack provides some advantages over for instance a free list, mainly due to cache improvements.
