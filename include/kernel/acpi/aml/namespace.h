/**
 * @brief Namespace and Namespace Overlays
 * @defgroup kernel_acpi_aml_namespace Namespace
 * @ingroup kernel_acpi_aml
 *
 * We need this slightly complex system as when a method runs it can create named objects that should not be visible
 * outside of the method, and when the method finishes these objects need to be removed. Additionally, if the method
 * calls itself, the new invocation should not see the objects created by the previous invocation. Note that "outside of
 * the method" means that if a inner method is defined inside another method the inner method will see the objects
 * created by the outer method.
 *
 * This is complex enough to need a example, good luck.
 * ```
 * Name (GLOB, 0) // Creates global GLOB with value 0
 *
 * Method (FUNA, 0, NotSerialized)
 * {
 *   Store(30, GLOB) // Updates global GLOB to 10
 *   // Store(0, _VAR) // Error, _VAR does not exist
 * }
 *
 * Method (FUNB, 0, NotSerialized)
 * {
 *   Name (_VAR, GLOB) // Creates _VAR and stores GLOB's value in it
 *   If (IsEqual(_VAR, 20)) // On the second call this will be true as GLOB was updated to 20 by FUNB
 *   {
 *     Return
 *   }
 *   Method (FUNC, 0, NotSerialized)
 *   {
 *      Store(0, _VAR) // Updates _VAR to 0
 *      Store(10, GLOB) // Updates global GLOB to 10
 *   }
 *   FUNC() // Calls inner FUNC
 *   Store(20, GLOB) // Updates global GLOB to 20
 *   FUNB() // Calls itself, will se its own _VAR which will contain the value in GLOB which is now 20
 *   FUNA() // Calls a outer method, cannot see _VAR and would error if it tried to access it
 *   // Method exists here, _VAR is removed
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This example does not include the edge case where a inner function calls the functions its defined inside of, but
 * it works the same way as calling a outer function.
 *
 * As far as i can tell, this does NOT apply to If, While, or other statements, only methods. So if you
 * create a named object inside an If statement it will be visible outside of the If statement.
 *
 * To solve this we give the `aml_state_t` a `aml_overlay_t` where it can create its named objects. When
 * looking up names we first look in the overlay of the current state and then in the parent overlay and so on until we
 * reach a `NULL` overlay. The last overlay will always be the "global" overlay. When invoking a method it will be given
 * its own `aml_state_t` and its own overlay, the parent of this overlay will be the "highest" overlay that contains the
 * invoked method, so if a inner method is invoked its parent overlay will be the overlay of the outer method. If a
 * outer method is invoked we move up the overlay chain until we find the overlay that contains the method and use that
 * as the parent overlay.
 *
 * Its important to note that overlays are *not* directories they are maps that map a parents id and a childs name to
 * the child object and that when combined form the complete heirarchy. Think of it like this, each overlay defines a
 * incomplete heirarchy of named objects, for example one overlay might define an object `\_FOO._BAR` but the parent
 * object `_FOO` is actually defined in the parent overlay.
 *
 * We also need the ability to commit any names created in a overlay to be globally visible if we are not
 * executing a method but instead parsing a DSDT or SSDT table. This is done using `aml_overlay_commit()`
 * which moves all the overlays objects to its parent overlay, which is usually the global overlay.
 *
 * Note that the term "namespace" in the ACPI specification does not refer to the entire "hierarchy" of named objects
 * but instead to an object that contains named objects, for example a Device object. Yes this is confusing.
 *
 * @see Section 5.3 of the ACPI specification for more details.
