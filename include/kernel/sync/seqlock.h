/**
 * @brief Sequence Lock
 * @defgroup kernel_sync_seqlock Seqlock
 * @ingroup kernel_sync
 *
 * A sequence lock is similar to a read-write lock, but optimized for scenarios where there are many more readers than
 * writers, or where reads are frequent and writes are rare.
 *
 * Readers can read the data without acquiring a lock, instead they check a "sequence number" before and after their
 * read to verify that no write occured during their read, if one did, they must retry their read.
 *
 * Writers acquire the lock exclusively and increment the "sequence number" before and after their write, this means
 * that readers can detect if a write has occured, and if a write is currently in progress by checking if the sequence
 * number is odd.
