/**
 * @brief System IO header.
 * @ingroup libstd
 * @defgroup libstd_sys_io System IO
 *
 * The `sys/io.h` header handles interaction with PatchworkOS's file system,
 * following the philosophy that everything is a file. This means interacting with physical devices,
 * inter-process communication (like shared memory), and much more is handled via files.
 *
 * ### Flags
 *
 * Functions like `open()` do not have a specific argument for flags, instead the filepath itself contains the flags.
 * This means that for example there is no need for a special "truncate" redirect in a shell (>>) instead you can just
 * add the "trunc" flag to the filepath and use a normal redirect (>).
 *
 * Here is an example filepath: `/this/is/a/path:with:some:flags`.
 *
 * Check the 'src/kernel/fs/path.h' file for a list of available flags.
 *
